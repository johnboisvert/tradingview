# Project Summary
CryptoIA Trading Platform is an advanced educational tool designed to empower users with knowledge about cryptocurrency trading and investment strategies. It integrates various analytical tools and resources to help users navigate market trends, manage their portfolios, and access real-time data, all supported by a robust Python/FastAPI backend and a React frontend.

# Project Module Description
The project is structured into several functional modules:
- **Backend**: Manages API requests and data processing using Python and FastAPI.
- **Frontend**: An interactive user interface built with React and TypeScript, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Database**: Utilizes SQLite to store user data, trading history, and application-related information.
- **Deployment**: Uses Railway for cloud hosting and automated deployments.
